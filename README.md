Project Title:
End-to-End Autonomous Line-Following System for Parrot Mambo Minidrone using MATLAB/Simulink

Project Overview:
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and real-world deployment of a complete autonomous line-following system for the Parrot Mambo minidrone, as part of the MathWorks Minidrone Competition. The workflow involves the development of robust algorithms for color-based path tracking, trajectory planning, and feedback control, all implemented within the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The project is divided into two primary stages: simulation-based validation and hardware deployment.

Technical Objectives:

1. Development of Vision-Based Line Detection Algorithm:
1.1 Utilize MATLABâ€™s Image Processing Toolbox and Computer Vision Toolbox to design algorithms for detecting and tracking colored lines in a 2D visual plane.

2. Path Planning and Error Estimation:
2.1 Generate a desired trajectory from the extracted line contour or centroids.

3. Control System Design:
3.1 Implement a feedback control system (such as PID or LQR) in Simulink to minimize lateral deviation and maintain alignment with the reference trajectory.

4. Simulation and Validation:
4.1 Use the Simulink 3D Animation Toolbox or UAV Library to simulate the drone's dynamics in a virtual environment.

5. Real-World Deployment on Parrot Mambo Minidrone:
5.1 Transfer the verified Simulink model to the physical Parrot Mambo drone using MATLAB Support Package for Parrot Minidrone.
