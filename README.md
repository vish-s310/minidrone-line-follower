Design and implement an end-to-end autonomous line-following system for a Parrot Mambo minidrone.
This includes path planning, image processing, and control algorithm development in simulation, followed by real-world deployment of the same system on the actual minidrone.

Objectives:

This project has two main objectives:
1. Color tracking algorithms are developed in MATLAB/Simulink. To do so, CV approaches will be applied.
2. Proposed algorithm will be tested in a real setup scenario.
